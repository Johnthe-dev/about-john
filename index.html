	<p id="para-one"><em style="color:blue">Every one needs to take chances.</em> That was John's motto as he quit his job and started down the road of professional web development. <em style="color:blue">We all want to do what we love. As the saying goes, if you do what you love you never work a day in your life!</em>
	</p>
	<h4>John has four goals in life:</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Travel to Wales.</li>
		<li>Bake the perfect pumpkin pie.</li>
		<li>Be the favorite uncle of all of his nieces</li>
